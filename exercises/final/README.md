## Plan for my game
### Game description:
This is a parkour adventure game. Players will control a role in a third-person perspective. This game will have many levels, and the difficult of each level will increase. In each level, there are various obstacles. For example, a barbed terrain or a large moving blade. Players need skill to control the role well and use parkour skills to avoid these obstacles. In difficult levels, AI enemies may appear, and these enemies will attack player. The goal in each level is to collect “coins”. Play must collect all the coins to pass the level. Some coin players may not be so easy to get. For example, these coins will be in a difficult position to reach or the player needs time to find. Every time when the player gets attacked from enemies or touch obstacles, he will lose some health. If the health bar is lower than 0, the player dies and game over, so the player must start over this level. There will be a signal at the end of each level, this signal may be a door. When the player has collected all the coins in this level, he can enter the door and the player will be taken to the next level. 
### Input:
The inputs of this game will be a keyboard. The player will use arrow keys to control the role to move, and space to jump, press shift to fast run. 
### Visual style:
This is a unity 3d game, so the map of each level will be a 3d world. The player will feel like he is in a open world, and he can control the role to move everywhere. Different levels will change the terrain as the difficulty changes. For example, in a simple level, the player will run on the ground most of the time. In difficult levels, the player will run on the roof, which may cause the player to fall and die. 
### Audio style:
There will be a background music in the main menu. When the player is playing the game, there is no background music. However, there are some sound effect while playing such as enemies attack sound, move sound, and run sound. I will use some more realistic sound effects in the game.
### Interface sketches:
The interface will contain player’s health bar, how many coins he collects, and the level where the player is.
### Theme:
The theme of this game will be an adventure game.
### Low bar:
The first level of this game will not be hard. Players will move on simple terrain without too many obstacles and no enemies.
### Targets:
The target for the player is to collect all coins in each level and pass all levels.
### High bar:
After the player pass the first level, the difficult will increase. Player has to be more careful in next levels. There will be more obstacles, and enemies will appear and attack player. At the same time, the player may need to move at high altitude, so you must always be careful to fall.
